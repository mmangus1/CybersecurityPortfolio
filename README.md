Matt's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Penetration Testing Using Home Lab/Equipment:

1.) Planning and Reconnaissance

Passive Reconnaissance:

  -OSINT Information Gathering:
  
  -Using tools such as Kali Linux's spiderfoot, I gathered details on myself, the only occupant of the apartment. I found and accessed online social media profiles, gathered emails and usernames. Found relevant personal information such as past addresses and known associates.

Active Reconnaissance:

 -Can't do dumpster diving, lockpicking or B & E due to legal concerns.

2.) Scanning and Discovery

  -Discover Open Ports/Services
  use nmap to

3.) Vulnerability Assessment

  -Determine Network Vulnerabilies
  use nessus to

  -Use eyes and ears to determine possible opportunistic scenarios

4.) Explotation

  -Gain Access
  use aircrack-ng to gain Wi-Fi access, use social engineering toolkit, use metasploit, maybe a third party RAT (Remote Attached Trojan)

  -Use USB Drop Key or Bluejacking/Bluesnarfing

5.) Maintaining Access & Persistence Testing

  - Keep persistant access using a RAT, Terminal Session, Remote Desktop, VPN or other means to access the network.
  - Try to "jump" around the network to find more vulnerabilities or data.

6.) Final Analysis and Reporting

  - Report vulnerabilities, using CVE or other relevent codes.
  - Write a report regarding physical security flaws that are easily eploited to gain access

7.) Post-Testing Remediation & Continuous Monitoring

  - Implement fixes, hopefully permanent ones
  - Keep software updated
  - Lower number of programs
  - Possible survelliance increase (cameras, security guards)
  - Possible hardware improvements (physical doors, alternative locks, etc...)
  - Lower wireless device power (reduces risk of outside attacks)
  - other remediations
